The Lemonade Hub, a company renowned for its innovative products, stands at a crossroads. For years, it has been the proud manufacturer of a product offered in two distinct models: a rigid model, which has been the company's stalwart offering, and a flexible model, introduced more recently as a strategic move to capture a new market segment. This introduction marked the beginning of a significant shift in the company's trajectory.

As the flexible model began to find its footing in the market, its sales soared, reflecting a growing consumer preference for this new option. However, this seemingly positive trend was shadowed by a perplexing development: the company's profits began a steady decline. This financial downturn sparked concern among the management, leading them to question the efficacy of their existing costing system. The system that once served them well appeared to falter in the face of the company's evolving product line and market dynamics.

The company's management, driven by a commitment to reverse the declining profit trend and ensure the sustainability of their operations, decided to delve into a comprehensive analysis of their past data. This decision underscored a pivotal shift in strategy, aiming to uncover the underlying causes of the profit slump. The goal is not merely to identify symptoms but to diagnose the root causes affecting the company's financial health using Power BI.

In embarking on this analytical journey, the company intends to achieve several key objectives:

    Accurate Cost Allocation: By scrutinizing past data, the company aims to ascertain whether the costing system accurately reflects the costs associated with manufacturing both the rigid and flexible models. The concern is that the existing system may not adequately differentiate between the cost structures of the two models, potentially leading to misallocated costs and misleading profit margins.

    Understanding Market Dynamics: The analysis will also focus on understanding the market dynamics that the flexible model tapped into. This includes identifying consumer preferences, market trends, and the competitive landscape that influenced the rapid sales increase of the flexible model.

    Evaluating Product Profitability: A critical aspect of the investigation will be to evaluate the profitability of each model. This involves dissecting the revenue and costs associated with the rigid and flexible models separately to determine their respective contributions to the overall profit decline.

    Strategic Decision Making: Armed with insights from the data analysis, the company plans to make informed strategic decisions. This may involve reevaluating the pricing strategy, adjusting production volumes, optimizing costs, or even reconsidering the product mix to align with market demand and profitability objectives.

In essence, The Lemonade Hub is on a quest to not only understand the paradox of increasing sales yet declining profits but also to lay the groundwork for a more robust and responsive strategy that ensures its long-term success in a dynamic market. This narrative of introspection, analysis, and strategic recalibration underscores the company's resilience and adaptability in the face of changing market realities.
